# Attitude Math Library

This library provides essential mathematical tools for handling attitudes in three-dimensional space. It provides library to handle Attitude Representation and Transformations for Engineers and Programmers in Python and C++, it includes two fundamental classes: Vector3 and Matrix33.

Engineers, Game Developers, 3D Graphics Programmers all require fundamental knowledge of attitude representations and transformations. 

**Why focus on Attitude?**

* Different attitude representations have different limitations, advantages and disadvantages.
* Different standards and conventions which can be confusing and are commonly misunderstood.
* Difficult for beginners to comprehend rotation transformations
* Fundamental concept used in engineering and programming (from autopilot control systems to computer games)

## Vector3 Class (Tested)
The Vector3 class encapsulates a three-dimensional vector, offering functionality for common vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, cross product, dot product, and normalization. Whether you're dealing with positions, velocities, or directions, the Vector3 class provides a versatile and efficient implementation to handle your needs.

## Matrix33 Class (On Progress)
The Matrix33 class represents a 3x3 matrix, supporting operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication (both scalar and matrix), inversion, and transformation of vectors. Whether you're working with rotations, transformations, or other linear mappings, the Matrix33 class offers a robust framework for manipulation.
